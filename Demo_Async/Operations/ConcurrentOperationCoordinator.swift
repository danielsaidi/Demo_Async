 This class implements `OperationCoordinator` as well as the
 `ConcurrentItemOperation` protocol.
 
 This coordinator performs operations concurrently. It could
 be used either directly or as an internal tool in any other
 classes, e.g. data syncers, to hide the "operation" concept
 from their external apis.
