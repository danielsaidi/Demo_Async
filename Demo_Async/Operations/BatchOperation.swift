/*
 
 This protocol can be implemented by classes that perform an
 operation on batches of items from a typed collection.
 
 When you implement this protocol, just implement everything
 that is required by `CollectionOperation` and implement the
 `perform(onBatch:completion:)` function as well.
 
 It's important to call the batch completion when each batch
 is processes, since operations may rely on it completion to
 coordinate their executions.
