 This class implements `OperationCoordinator` as well as the
 `SerialItemOperation` protocol.
 
 This coordinator performs a set of operations in serial. It
 can be used either directly or as an internal tool in other
 classes, e.g. data syncers, to hide the "operation" concept
 from their external apis.
