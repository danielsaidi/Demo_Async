 This protocol can be implemented by classes that perform an
 operation on individual items in a typed collection.
 
 When you implement this protocol, just implement everything
 that is required by `CollectionOperation` and implement the
 `perform(onItem:completion:)` function as well.
 
 It is important to call the item completion when every item
 is processes, since operations may rely on it completion to
 coordinate their executions.
